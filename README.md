# Stablediffusion-CompatibleAMD-Build *python

Firstly appreciate the acknowledgement of my production 
To use this build first be sure to have python 3.7-9 installed on your system the newer versions of pytho do not have great compatability with stable diffusion 1.4. 

Secondly be sure microsoft onnx is installed on your system so stable diffusion can read the text 

Third when typing in demands please acknowledge the scale of your graphics card rendering can take a long time depeding on what you put in 

the code is not compatiable with all forms of linux such as mint and elementary os 

Lastly enjoy ! theres a host of feature you can exploit !
